      <h3>Back End Engineer</h3>
      <br></br>
      <p>
       I started my passion in the technical industry in my early years of community college. Now I'm 22 years old, graduated with a Degree in Computer Science from University of California Irvine, and I love to develop.
       I currently work at Orbee Auto Inc. which is the first marketing cloud built for automotive dealerships. As a Backend Engineering Associate I work closely with the Senior Software Engineers, the Data Engineering team, and the Marketing team to produce solutions and implement micro-services in our platform. 
       I primarily develop in Ruby on Rails and use AWS tools.
       Outside of software, I like to explore the nature, work out, watch tv shows (Mind Hunter, Dexter, and Designated Survior), hike, and occasionally travel.
